## The Blockchain Part Of the Eternitas Domain Modell ##

It is necessary to reduce the Eternitas use case in such a way, that only
the parts related to the *delegation of trust* will be implemented
by blockchain technology, and nothing else. 

Any blockchain -- still at the time of
writing -- can be considered as a *distributed public ledger*, and nothing
else. 

This implies that a blockchain cannot be considered as a database and
should be used for the "trust related" parts of any asset transfer **only** 
(Of course an inheritance case can be seen as a special case of an asset
tranfer).

We see the following actors:

1. *Testator* 
2. *Heir* (One or many)
3. *Eternitas Smart Contract*: 
4. *Password Manager*: 
5. *Parish Register*:
