## The Blockchain Part Of the Eternitas Domain Modell ##

It is necessary to reduce the Eternitas use case in such a way, that only
the parts related to the *delegation of trust* will be implemented
by blockchain technology, and nothing else. Any blockchain, at the time of
writing, still can be considered as a *distributed public ledger*, and nothing
else. This implies that a blockchain cannot be considered as a database and
should be used for the "trust related" parts of any asset transfer **only** 
(Of course an inheritance case can be seen as a special case of an asset
tranfer).
