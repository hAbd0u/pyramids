### Extend `ETERNITAS-DATA` ###

   - Field `publisher` for the public key
   - Field `date`  for the time stamp 
   - Field`signed-date` for the signed time stamp

### Extend `Eternitas`-Object ###

  - New field for title
  - New field for author

One could abuse the text field such that you can enter title and author. At the moment, 
it only works with `CID`s for IPFS, and the `CID` must refer to an
`ETERNITAS-DATA`-Objekt. Syntax:

        title: This is the title
        
or

        author: Peter Sellers
        
So, if you enter this data, the `Eternitas`-Object is updated, and you need to press
the Key-Button again for saving.
        

### New buttons ###

- Button that creates a new key pair (Representing the identity)
- Button that creates a new key for symmetric encryption

Both buttons: after pressing them, you need to safe the wallet again by clicking the top left
